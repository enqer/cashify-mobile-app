# Cashify - mobile app

Have you ever had a situation where you didn't have money on you or one of your friends forgot his wallet?
Eventually one of you borrowed money from the other person but unfortunately forgot to give it back later because he didn't write it down anywhere or wrote down a note somewhere on his phone and later forgot where.

Never again, which is why Cashify was created
which is a place where we write down our "loans".

## How it works?
In fact, it is very simple.
When we launch our application then we will see the start page on which there is the logo of the application and the board on which are displayed 
total loans such as "Loans from" and "Loans to":

* Loans from - these are the money that someone has borrowed from us
* Loans to - these are the money we borrowed from someone

To add a new entry, just click the "ADD NEW" button and then you will be redirected to a short form.

To see our entries we click in our bottom navigation.

If we want to check a particular entry then we simply click on it.
On the other hand, if we want to delete an entry then we just move the given entry to the right. On the other hand, if we would like to sort the entries just click on "Name" or "Balance" depending on how we want to sort the data

In the attached image we can see the entry we created.

We can remove any description of borrowed money when we have already received or returned the money
